            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>This deceptively simple buttermilk biscuit recipe can come out a million different ways with some very minor variations on the ingredients and amounts. This one's my favorite â€” flaky, but not dry; chewy, but not tough; and crisp in just the right spots. Ice-cold butter and some extra dough folding are key to having lots of flaky layers in each golden brown buttermilk biscuit..</p>

              <h2>step 1</h2>
              <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.</p>
              <h2>step 2</h2>
              <p>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add cold butter slices and cut into the flour with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>
              <h2>step 3</h2>
              <p>Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour cold buttermilk into the well and stir gently until just combined.</p>
              <h2>step 4</h2>
              <p>Turn dough onto a floured work surface and pat it together into a rectangle.</p>
              <h2>step 5</h2>
              <p>Fold the rectangle in thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle. Repeat twice more, folding and pressing the dough a total of three times.</p>
              <h2>step 6</h2>
              <p>Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits. Reroll any scraps to cut more biscuits; you should get 12 total.</p>
              <h2>step 7</h2>
              <p>Transfer biscuits to the prepared baking sheet. Press an indent into the top of each biscuit with your thumb. Brush buttermilk over the tops.</p>
              <h2>step 8</h2>
              <p>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are flaky and golden brown, about 15 minutes.</p>
